# (c) Infomotions, LLC; distributed under a GNU Public License

# April 27, 2026 - first cut
# April 28, 2026 - added unigrams; this is working!
# April 29, 2026 - added sentences and rdr.keywords
# May    3, 2026 - added a few more tools and associated prompts; I don't think resources work
# May    7, 2026 - added even more tool; this is really working very well
# May    8, 2026 - added get full path to original items
# May   11, 2026 - cleaned up naming conventions; works the same though
# May   15, 2026 - refined inline to expose interesting, POS, and entity words; limite results to segments of lists
# May   24, 2026 - refined the documentation regarding items; works better
# May   25, 2026 - added getAuthors, getTitles, and getDates
# May   28, 2026 - refined getSentencesWord
# June   2, 2026 - removed getSentencesWord; too complicated
# June   9, 2026 - after using a larger underneath model, restored getSentencesWord; kewl
# June  17, 2026 - added additional local URLs
# June  22, 2026 - added some refactoring bits as suggestet by an LLM; hmmm.
# July  14, 2026 - add save to a file; at the cabin

In short this server supplements the traditional reading process with distant reading techiques. Intended to be used by students, researchers, and scholars, this server is a tool designed to help with the problem of information overoad.
